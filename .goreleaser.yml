    ## Funtoo Macaroni {{ .Tag }}!

    A new release of Phoenix branch is out!

    This release contains the first big change before upgrading to Funtoo Next branch
    and leaving 1.4-prime release.

    A lot of packages are been upgraded and it's been dropped the support to Python 2.7.
    The package Python 2.7 will be available because a lot of Funtoo packages depend on
    it for compilation but it's discouraged the use.

    Another big news is the support of LXQT and I3 DE that will be available also as ISOs.

    Kernel 6.3 is also available for testing but without extra kernel modules (NVIDIA, ZFS,
    etc.).

    About languages upgraded:

      * Go 1.20.3
      * NodeJs 14.21.2
      * Rust 1.69.0

    See the above list for all upgrade details.

    Many thanks to all [Funtoo](https://www.funtoo.org/) devs that are the sap of all this.

    Enjoy!
