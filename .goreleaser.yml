    ## Macaroni {{ .Tag }}!

    A new release of Macaroni Eagle is out!

    This is the second bugfix release that contains the
    revision of the FreeRadius package with the
    fix of the .service file.

    Many thanks to all Macaroni OS devs and contributors that are the sap of all this.

    Enjoy!
