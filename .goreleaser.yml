    ## Funtoo Macaroni {{ .Tag }}!

    A new release of Phoenix branch is out!

    This release is a maintenance release that add support to kernels 6.0 and 6.1
    (without Nvidia support for now) and it introduces experimental packages for
    Enlightenment and Mate that could be used in the near future for a specific
    ISO related to the two DE.

    See the above list for all upgrade details.

    Many thanks to all [Funtoo](https://www.funtoo.org/) devs that are the sap of all this.

    Enjoy!
