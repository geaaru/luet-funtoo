    A new release of Macaroni Eagle is out!

    In the last few days, a critical security issue has been shared
    in the community about the package xz-utils.
    Luckily, the Macaroni Eagle stable release has not been affected,
    but this security issue was already with an affected release in the
    development branch where we have downgraded the xz-utils version
    to version 5.4.6. See CVE-2024-3094.
    We hope that something like this will not happen in the future.

    See the above list for all upgrade details.

    In evidence:

      * Rust 1.77.0

      * Golang 1.22.0

      * Bind 9.18.25

      * Prometheus 2.51.0

      * Grafana 10.4.1

      * PHP 8.2.17

      * OpenSSH 9.7_p1

      * Incus 0.6.0

      * Strongswan 5.9.14

    Many thanks to all [Funtoo](https://www.funtoo.org/) devs that are the sap of all this.

    Enjoy!
