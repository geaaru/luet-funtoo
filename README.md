# macaroni-funtoo
Funtoo Macaroni Repository Tree

Branches behavior:
* `master`: single packages tree based on 1.4-prime release.

* `next-release`: Related to the new `next-release` release of Funtoo.
  This branch will be based on only single packages and
  integrated with `luet-portage-converter`.

* `systemd`: related to a not funtoo supported release with SystemD.
  The idea is to use it only for Server ISO release and as experimental
  base rootfs where we will develop an alternative tool that will
  replace SystemD probably written in Golang. Stay tuned!.


## Generate packages with `luet-portage-converter`

To generate specs for all packages defined on rules and their dependencies (runtime and buildtime):
```bash
$> luet-portage-converter generate -t ./packages/  --to . --rules portage-converter/office.yaml --ignore-missing-deps  --with-portage-pkg   --enable-stage4 --disable-conflicts
```

To generate specs for a specific package defined on rules and their dependencies (runtime and buildtime):

```bash
$> luet-portage-converter generate -t ./packages/  --to . --rules portage-converter/office.yaml --ignore-missing-deps  --with-portage-pkg   --enable-stage4 --disable-conflicts --pkg app/foo
```

NOTE: The `kit_cache` directory is generated by the `lxd-compose` command:

```
$> lxd-compose c r metatools-services reposcan-funtoo-kits
```
