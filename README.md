## Generate packages with `luet-portage-converter`

To generate specs for all packages defined on rules and their dependencies (runtime and buildtime):
```bash
$> luet-portage-converter generate -t ./packages/  --to . --rules portage-converter/office.yaml --ignore-missing-deps  --with-portage-pkg   --enable-stage4 --disable-conflicts
```

To generate specs for a specific package defined on rules and their dependencies (runtime and buildtime):

```bash
$> luet-portage-converter generate -t ./packages/  --to . --rules portage-converter/office.yaml --ignore-missing-deps  --with-portage-pkg   --enable-stage4 --disable-conflicts --pkg app/foo
```

NOTE: The `kit_cache` directory is generated by the `lxd-compose` command:

```
$> lxd-compose c r metatools-services reposcan-funtoo-kits
```
